OBJECTIVE:
The data is from an experiment on Human Activity Recognition.
The experiment was conducted to take 66 variables (measurements from sensors) from 30 subjects during 6 different activities while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone.  21 subjects were randomly assigned to Train group and 9 to Test Group.
The objective of this project is to create a table showing means of varibales which name includes "mean()" and "std()" for each subject and each activity.

Used R Packages:
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(stringi)

Data:
Source: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
File name and ocontent:
"activity_labels.txt"  - a list of activity names
"features.txt" - a list of varibale(measurement) names
"subject_test.txt" - subject # of Test Group
"subject_train.txt" - subject # of Train Group
"X_test.txt"- data for Test Group
"X_train.txt"- data for Train Group
"y_test.txt"- subjects of Test Group
"y_train.txt"- subjects of Train Group

Step1: Create a combined tabel listing all data for all subjects, called "TrainTest"
- Read all the files.
- Create a Test data set and Train data set listing all the subjects and the data for each group using cbind.
- Combine both Test and Train Group data into one table using rbind and name the object (data frame) as  "TrainTest" 

Step2: Name variables #4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
#name variables
feature_names <- as.character(feature[,2])
vari_names <- c("subID","TrainTestLabel",feature_names)
names(TrainTest) <- vari_names

#2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
#select columns including the word mean() and std()
#make characters of variable names including mean() and std()

mean <- grep("mean()",names(TrainTest),value = T, fixed = T)
std <- grep("std()",names(TrainTest),value = T, fixed = T)

#subset TrainTest datafram with only columns with subID, TrainTestLavel and mean() and std()
TrainTest_Selected <- TrainTest[,c("subID","TrainTestLabel",mean,std)]

#3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
TrainTest_3 <- merge(TrainTest_Selected,actnames,by.x = "TrainTestLabel",by.y = "V1",all.x = T)
names(TrainTest_3) <- sub("V2","Activity",names(TrainTest_3)) 

#5.From the data set in step #4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

##put all the variables to gether to prep for melting

melt <- melt(TrainTest_3,id=c("subID","Activity"),measure.vars=c(mean,std))

#make a table showing means for each variable, each activitity, and each subject
aggregate <- aggregate(melt$value, list(subject = melt$subID,activity = melt$Activity,variable = melt$variable),mean,na.rm=T)

#create txt file from the data.frame "aggregate"
write.table(aggregate, file = "CourseraProject4.txt",sep = "|",row.names = F,col.names = T)
read.table("CourseraProject4.txt",header = FALSE, sep = "|")
